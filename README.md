# Amazon Product Review Analysis
Product and customer review data analysis to generate insights that can guide product improvement, marketing strategies, and customer engagement (excel based).

## **Project Overview**

### **Case Study Context**
This project is part of an internship simulation at *RetailTech Insights*, an e-commerce analytics firm. As a Data Analyst, the goal is to analyze Amazon product and customer review data to uncover actionable insights that can guide:

- Product improvement

- Marketing strategies

- Customer engagement

#### **Dataset Overview**
The dataset was sourced from Amazon product pages and contains:

- Product Information: Name, category, price, discount, average rating

- Customer Engagement: Review counts, review titles, and content summaries

- Each row represents a unique product, with some fields (e.g. reviews) containing aggregated or comma-separated values.

- Total Records: 1,465 rows

- TotalFields: 16 columns

#### **Analysis Objectives**
Using Excel tools such as Pivot Tables, Conditional Formatting, and Calculated Columns, the project answers the following key business questions:

1) Average discount percentage by category
2)  Product count per category
3)  Total number of reviews by category
4)  Highest average ratings
5)  Comparison of average actual price vs. discounted price by category
6)  Most reviewed products
7)  Number of products with ≥50% discount
8)  Distribution of product ratings (e.g., 3.0, 4.0, etc.)
9)  Potential revenue by category (actual_price × rating_count)
10)  Product count by price range: < ₹200, ₹200–₹500, > ₹500
11)  Relationship between rating and discount
12)  Products with fewer than 1,000 reviews
13)  Categories with highest-discounted products
14)  Top 5 products based on combined rating and review count

#### Key Insights 

**Top Performing Categories**: Categories like Electronics and Accessories show higher average ratings and engagement.

**Rating & Review Trends**: Majority of product ratings fall within the 3.5–4.5 range.

**Price Buckets**: The majority of products fall in the ₹200–₹500 price bucket.
-Very few products are priced above ₹500, suggesting a budget-conscious customer base.

**Low-Visibility Products**: A large number of products have fewer than 1,000 reviews, suggesting opportunities to improve visibility or marketing.

#### Recommendations
**Optimize Pricing Strategy**: Focus promotions on the ₹200–₹500 price range to align with consumer buying behavior.
-Re-evaluate pricing of underperforming products in higher brackets.

**Enhance Product Visibility**: Invest in marketing for products with low review counts but high ratings to boost engagement.
-Use high-performing products to cross-promote others in the same category.

**Leverage Discount Insights**: Continue offering competitive discounts in categories that respond well to price drops.
-Monitor if high discounts correlate with long-term customer satisfaction or just short-term gains.
