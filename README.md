# DSA-EXCEL-PROJECT-
Comprehensive Excel project on Amazon case study, including complete dataset, analysis steps, and visualizations with a step-by-step breakdown.

## **Project Topic**: Amazon Product Review Analysis 

### **Project Overview**
#### Case Study Context 
This project is part of an internship simulation at *RetailTech Insights*, an e-commerce analytics firm. As a Junior Data Analyst, the goal is to analyze Amazon product and customer review data to uncover actionable insights that can guide:

- Product improvement

- Marketing strategies

- Customer engagement

#### Dataset Description
The dataset was sourced from Amazon product pages and contains:

Product Information: Name, category, price, discount, average rating

Customer Engagement: Review counts, review titles, and content summaries

Each row represents a unique product, with some fields (e.g. reviews) containing aggregated or comma-separated values.

#### Analysis Objectives
Using Excel tools such as Pivot Tables, Conditional Formatting, and Calculated Columns, the project answers the following key business questions:

Average discount percentage by category

Product count per category

Total number of reviews by category

Top-rated products

Comparison of average actual price vs. discounted price

Most reviewed products

Number of products with ≥50% discount

Distribution of product ratings (e.g., 3.0, 4.0, etc.)

Potential revenue by category (actual_price × rating_count)

Product count by price range: < ₹200, ₹200–₹500, > ₹500

Relationship between rating and discount

Products with fewer than 1,000 reviews

Categories with highest-discounted products

Top 5 products based on combined rating and review count

#### Final Task: Excel Dashboard
A clean, interactive Excel dashboard is created based on the insights generated. This includes:

- Key performance indicators (KPIs)

- Interactive slicers and filters

- Visualizations (bar, pie, line charts)

- Dynamic summaries for category- and product-level insights

#### Tools Used
1 Microsoft Excel

2 Pivot Tables

3 Formulas (SUMIF, AVERAGEIF, IF, VLOOKUP, etc.)

4 Conditional Formatting

5 Charts and Graphs

6 Dashboard Design
